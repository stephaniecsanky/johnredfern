        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                <p class="p-home">John Redfern was born in 1962 and is a prolific artist living and working in Brantford, Ontario. He has demonstrated a strong artistic talent since he was a young boy and has been involved with various artistic projects dating back to both public and high school where he was called on to paint murals and other designs. It was during that period that he developed a mural of the well-known Graham Bell Homestead (acrylic medium) that was displayed at the school’s “Spirit 77.” In addition, John has had some of his works displayed at the Glenhyrst Art Gallery of Brantford over the years.</p>

				<p>John went on to study realism and other techniques in both oil and acrylic mediums under the guidance of well known Kitchener, Ontario artist, Michael Roth, as well as detailed critique from famous Canadian artist Peter Etril Snyder of Kitchener/Waterloo. Recent exhibitions include his work in the Brantford, Ontario Station Gallery in the December 2012 Snow Show as well as the blue Dog Café Gallery where a month-long exhibition of many of his works focused on John’s landscape and wildlife pieces.</p>

				<p>His use of colour as well as composition gives his paintings a strong sense of depth and appeal. He likes to portray a sense of realistic study within his work while at the same time giving the viewer a story within the actual piece itself. He also has work hanging in many local Ontario cafes, and restaurants and has many commissioned pieces adorning the walls of both commercial and residential homes throughout southwestern Ontario region. These include pet portraits, homesteads compositions, outdoor landscapes and personal portraits.</p>

				<p>His favourite pastime is to be one with nature and John can be found many weekends with his easel painting one of the many back roads or rivers of Ontario or capturing a picture of nature that can be used to portray a very expressive painting of our beautiful Canadian wilderness.</p>
